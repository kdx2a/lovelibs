# lovelibs
A small LÃ–VE 2D utility that downloads and 'update' common libs. Small personnal project, don't take it too seriously.
Require Lua 5.1 or superior and `wget`.

# usage
Install lib(s) (see list of libs bellow)  
`lovelibs install <lib(s)>`

Remove lib(s)  
`lovelibs remove <lib(s)>`

List installed libs  
`lovelibs list`

Update libs  
`lovelibs update`

# libs
Since this was create for personnal projects, I will add libs used in my
projects when I need them. Feel free to add on the list and make a pull
request.
